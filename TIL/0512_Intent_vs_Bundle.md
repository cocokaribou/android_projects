## Intent vs Bundle
### Bundle
- a collection of key-value pairs

### Intent
- an abstract description of an operation to be performed.
	- Component Name
	- Action
	- Category
	- Data
	- Extras
	- Flag


## why choose bundle over an intent
- Becuase you sometimes need a collection of key-value pairs that *don't have the pre-defined signification* the fields of the Intent have.
