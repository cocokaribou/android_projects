## Kotlin
- concise, safe, interoperable with Java and other languages
- provides many ways to reuse code between multiple platforms for productive programming
- [reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html)

## The philosophy of Kotlin
- pragmatic
- concise
- safe
	- means its design prevents certain kinds or errors in a program
	- handling NPE, `ClassCastException` etc.
- interoperable

## Kotlin's primary traits
- target platforms: anywhere Java runs
- statically typed
- functional and object-oriented
	- functions as values
	- conciseness : lets you avoid duplication in your code
	- safe multithreading : immutable objects + pure functions = being able to avoid unsafe modification of the same data from multiple threads
	- easier testing
